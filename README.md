https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download
Generated by PaySim. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, a provider of the mobile financial service.

Dataset consists of 6,362,620 with 11 columns - incl. transaction type, amount, sender and receiver id, sender balance before and after transaction, receivers balance before and after transaction. 

<br>

**Tools & Techniques:**<br>
**Python:** Data Sampling (Stratified method)<br>
**Power Query:** Data Cleaning, Formatting<br>
**Power BI:** Visualiusation<br>
**DAX functions:** Data Aggregation, functioName, functionName…<br>

<br>

**Findings:**<br>
• Fraudsters deplete the balance using CASH_OUT and transfer the same amount to another account. A large transaction occurs every 5 days.
 
• We assume that due to (patterns), there could be money laundering etc. to further investivatge, we will request for more information to other teams.   

<br>

**Challenges / Constraints:**<br>
• A lot of information is missing (due to private nature of data) - there is limitation in conducting in depth analysis due to lack of info.

• Consumes time to load due to data size (6M rows).
